# CardioSense
The heart disease detection model developed by CardioSense is powered by logistic regression, a robust classification algorithm. This model analyzes a comprehensive set of 
risk factors and medical attributes to accurately predict the presence of heart disease in individuals. By considering factors such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, 
and blood pressure, the model leverages patterns and relationships in the data to provide reliable predictions. The output of the model is a binary classification, indicating
whether an individual is likely to have heart disease or not. This model enables timely intervention and preventive measures, assisting healthcare professionals in identifying
individuals at higher risk and taking appropriate actions.
